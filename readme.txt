1. Are there known issues or functions that aren't working currently in your
   attached code? If so, explain. (note that you will get half credit for any reasonably sized bug that is fully explained in the readme)
	None
3. What problems did you face developing code for this project? Around how long did you spend on this project (This helps me decide what I need to explain more clearly for the next projects)
	The main issue was the speed at which ilab was running causing unexpected exceptions, adding a sleep.3 helped, the groupme suggested so
4. What makes this password server insecure?
	The data is all plaintext, the cookies are nonpersistent, and the data is stored in txt plain text. Also, it is very prone to a brute force attack.
